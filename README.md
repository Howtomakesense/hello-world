# hello-world

Hi everybody. I'm learning how to code and my goal is to learn html5, css, java, and python. In order to do this I have resolved to code everyday and make at least one change or addition to my github account everyday. I would like to be able to create at least something everyday no matter how insignificant it is, but i might have to start that a little later after i gain enough knowledge about the variuos tools to know what i can create.
